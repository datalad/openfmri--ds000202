= Project Summary =
In this study we tested the heterogeneity in obtained correlations 
between gray matter morphology and the personality trait 
‘Harm Avoidance’ (HA).

95 healthy female volunteers (age: 18-30 years) were recruited to participate 
in the study. All underwent a T1 weighted anatomical scan of the head 
(TI/TR/TE=940.4/7.6/3.7ms, flip angle=8°, FOV=240x240x200mm³, 
resolution=1x1x2mm³) at a Philips 3T Achieva MRI scanner. A score for all 
personality traits as defined in Cloninger’s psychobiological model of 
personality was obtained using the ‘Revised Temperament and Character 
Inventory’ (TCI).
